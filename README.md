# Theia Technologies motor control board GUI
[Theia Technologies](https://www.theiatech.com) offers a [MCR600 motor control board](https://www.theiatech.com/lenses/accessories/mcr/) for controlling Theia's motorized lenses.  This board controls focus, zoom, iris, and IRC filter motors.  It can be connected to a host comptuer by USB, UART, or I2C connection.  

# Features
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="python" width="20" height="20"/> Theia has developed this GUI application ([compiled version](https://bit.ly/48TQwgE)) to allow easy control of Theia's lenses using the MCR600-IQ and similar control boards.  The GUI is based on Theia's [motor control module](https://github.com/cliquot22/TheiaMCR).   

- Move motors by a relative number of steps. 
- Move motors to an absolute step position. 
- Use the GUI application as a development platform for your own application.  

# Quick start
Connect the motor control board to the host Windows comptuer with a USB cable.  The quick start guide can be downloaded from Theia's shared Dropbox folder [MCR instructions](https://bit.ly/3HqcgFf)
