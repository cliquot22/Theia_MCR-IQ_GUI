# Theia Technologies motor control board GUI
[Theia Technologies](https://www.theiatech.com) offers a [MCR IQ 600 motor control board](https://www.theiatech.com/lenses/accessories/mcr/) for controlling Theia's motorized lenses.  This board controls focus, zoom, iris, and IRC filter motors.  It can be connected to a host comptuer by USB, UART, or I2C connection.  This GUI application allows easy control of the lens motors.  

# Features
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="python" width="20" height="20"/> Theia has developed this GUI application ([compiled version](https://theiatech.com/MCR-IQ-GUI)) to allow easy control of Theia's lenses using the MCR IQ 600 and similar control boards.  The GUI is based on Theia's [motor control module](https://github.com/cliquot22/TheiaMCR).   

- Move motors by a relative number of steps. 
- Move motors to an absolute step position. 
- Control the IR cut switch and lens iris positions.
